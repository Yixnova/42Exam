# :sparkles: Ecole 42 Exam

Ecole 42 breaks away from the traditional classroom model by offering an innovative, fully project-based and peer-to-peer learning experience. This README outlines the general framework of Ecole 42’s exam system, with a special focus on the dynamics and content of **Exam Rank02**.

## About the Ecole 42 Exam System

- **Gamification and Leveling Up:**  
  At Ecole 42, learning is structured like a game where you earn points and level up. Each project or exam challenges students to prove their technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and time management skills. As you progress, you unlock new projects and learning paths.

- **Self-Paced Learning:**  
  Students have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and retake the exam. In the event of a failure, the exam process resets and you start again from level 1. This approach supports continuous learning and personal growth.

## What is Exam Rank02?

**Exam Rank02** is one of the first exams in the Ecole 42 curriculum. Its key features are:

- **Scope:**  
  The exam is based on implementing fundamental functions and algorithms in C.

- **Level-Based Structure:**  
  The exam is divided into four levels, with each level featuring a specific group of functions. The goal is to successfully pass all levels and score a total of 100 points. If you fail, you must re-enter the exam from level 1 every week until you “fall into the Black Hole” no more and finally succeed.

- **Randomized Questions:**  
  In each exam attempt, different questions are selected at random, ensuring that every attempt presents a unique level of difficulty and content.

- **Time and Resource Restrictions:**  
  During the exam, you are given a fixed amount of time and must write your code without internet access. Additionally, speaking or leaving your workstation is strictly forbidden. While code standard checks (Norminette) are not performed during the exam, the primary focus is on the correctness of the functions and the efficiency of the implemented algorithms.

Good luck and happy coding!
